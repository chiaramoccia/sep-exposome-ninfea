# Exposome & Socioeconomic Position in Early Childhood (NINFEA Cohort)

This repository contains a demonstration of the methods used in the study:

**"Modelling socioeconomic position as a driver of the exposome in the first 18 months of life of the NINFEA birth cohort children"**

### ðŸ§ª Summary

We investigated how **socioeconomic position (SEP)** influences early-life **exposome** profiles, using data from the NINFEA cohort (Italy). We applied:

- **Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS)**: SEP as exposure, environmental variables as outcomes
- **Cluster Analysis**: grouping children by exposure patterns
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: dimensionality reduction within each exposure group

### ðŸ“Š Methods (Demonstrated Here)

Due to data confidentiality, this repository contains:

- Simulated dataset mimicking the structure of the original NINFEA data
- Example scripts for:
  - Logistic regressions (ExWAS)
  - PCA within exposure groups
  - Clustering of individuals
- Sample visualizations
