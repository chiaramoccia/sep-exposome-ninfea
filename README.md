# Modelling socioeconomic position as a driver of the exposome in the first 18 months of life of the NINFEA birth cohort children

This repository contains a demonstration of the methods used in the study:

**"Modelling socioeconomic position as a driver of the exposome in the first 18 months of life of the NINFEA birth cohort children"**

### ðŸ“Š Summary

We investigated how **socioeconomic position (SEP)** influences early-life **exposome** profiles, using data from the NINFEA cohort (Italy). We applied:

- **Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS)**: SEP as exposure, environmental variables as outcomes
- **Cluster Analysis**: grouping children by exposure patterns
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: dimensionality reduction within each exposure group
