### ðŸ“Š Summary

We explored the role of **socioeconomic position (SEP)** in shaping the **early-life exposome** using data from the Italian **NINFEA birth cohort**.  
The following analytical approaches were applied:

- **Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS)**  
  SEP modeled as the exposure; environmental variables as outcomes.

- **Cluster Analysis**  
  To group children based on similar exposure patterns.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) / Factor Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD)**  
  To reduce dimensionality within each exposure domain.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Make sure the following R packages are installed:

- `tidyverse`  
- `polycor`  
- `corrplot`  
- `broom`  
- `RColorBrewer`  
- `calibrate`  
- `robustHD`  
- `SpectralClMixed`  
- `foreign`  
- `nnet`  
- `stargazer`  
- `DescTools`

Install them in R with:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "polycor", "corrplot", "broom", "RColorBrewer", 
                   "calibrate", "robustHD", "SpectralClMixed", "foreign", 
                   "nnet", "stargazer", "DescTools"))
```
